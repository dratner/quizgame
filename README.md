BUGS

* Show results only shows one user submitted answer

TODO

* Add timeouts for answers? Or for other states?
* Make timer/timeouts optional at new game time
* Add commentary field for 	game comments
* Add error message if you try to join a game that doesn't exist
* Add an indicator somewhere of how many questions remain
* Add more caching - we don't need to compute question results each time, for example.
