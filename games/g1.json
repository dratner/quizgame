Employing his characteristically humoristic wit and flare for regional dialect, Twain crafts a story which at once explores the magnificence of the wild west and dispels its romanticized mythology. Called out west to help his brother, Orion, who has been appointed Secretary of Nevada, the two travel from their homes in Missouri aboard the Overland Stage. In relating the trip, the rugged brilliance of the open frontier of the American West is beautifully depicted. Parting ways with his brother, Twain continues on from Salt Lake City to San Francisco and ultimately the Kingdom of Hawaii. Along the way numerous anecdotes of humorous adventures and mishaps of Twain’s experiences with Mormons, Native Americans, mining, and real estate speculation are satirically told.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuggested by Dan Ratner\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
